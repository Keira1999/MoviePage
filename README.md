# Movie Page - Advanced Web Applications Project
This project is a **React-based movie website** developed by a group of four students. It was built primarily with **JavaScript**, alongside **CSS, and HTML**, and retrieves movie information retrieved from external APIs, including **The Movie Database (TMDB)** and **Finnkino’s public API**. The project focused on user interface design and working with external APIs.

### Key Features
- Browse and search movies using **The Movie Database (TMDB) API**
    - Filter movies by **title, genre, and release year**
    - View **detailed movie information** in a dedicated movie view
- Retrieve movie showtimes from **Finnkino’s API**, filtered by theater and date
- **Registered users** can add movies to a favorites list and leave a review
- **Group management functionality**, allowing users to create and manage groups
- **Responsive layout** that adapts to different screen sizes

### Technologies Used

- JavaScript  
- CSS

## My Contribution
I implemented the group functionality and group view, including basic group management features such as creating and deleting groups, as well as allowing users to join and leave existing groups. In addition, I contributed to visual adjustments and UI/UX improvements together with the team.

## What I Learned  
This project helped me better understand how dynamic web applications can be built using external APIs and how frontend logic adapts to changing data sources. 

## Link to the Movie Page

Since the project was completed, Finnkino has updated their website, causing the API used in this project to become unavailable. As a result, some features of the Movie Page no longer work as intended.
